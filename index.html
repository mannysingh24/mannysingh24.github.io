                    <p>
                        My name is Mandeep Chera, and I recently graduated with a bachelors degree in Computer Science and a minor in Business at the University of California San Diego. My passion revolves around programming, specifically software development,
                        machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I strive to learn everything that I can
                        on the subject out of pure interest and to ensure that I make true industry
                        contributions. I decided to minor in Business in addition to a major in Computer Science to
                        make certain that I have the knowledge to fully help the company I work for. As a
                        hardworking individual, I want to provide as much contribution as I can into
                        anything that I do. I would describe myself as a hardworking, determined, and loyal individual.
                        When it comes to school work, projects, or anything related, I ensure that the
                        work is done effectively and in a timely manner. I try my best to go above and
                        beyond the requirements of my task, and ensure that everything is done in detail
                        and is thorough.

                    <h5>Database Developer<span> - Nordensight Tech and NEHA</span></h5>
                    <p>
                        As a contract worker, I had the privilege of working with Nordensight Tech and NEHA (National Environmental Health Association) on an exciting project that involved creating a comprehensive relational database using Microsoft Access of retail food and environmental health contacts for all of the United States. This was a significant undertaking that required careful research and attention to detail.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My role in the project involved identifying and compiling contact information for a wide range of stakeholders, including state and local health departments, regulatory agencies, and industry associations. This involved conducting extensive online research, reaching out to industry experts and government officials, and using various software tools to organize and manage the data.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The project was particularly challenging due to the sheer size and scope of the database. It required collecting and organizing information on thousands of contacts across all 50 states, which required a high degree of organization, focus, and attention to detail.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Despite the challenges, the project was a great success, and I am proud to have played a key role in its completion. The final database provided a valuable resource for those working in the retail food and environmental health industries, enabling them to access up-to-date contact information for key stakeholders and regulatory bodies across the United States.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In addition to its importance for the retail food industry, the database that we created also had significant implications for environmental health. This is because many of the contacts in the database were regulatory agencies and other organizations responsible for monitoring and regulating environmental health issues, such as air and water quality, hazardous waste management, and pest control.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        By providing accurate and up-to-date contact information for these organizations, the database that we created helped to ensure that environmental health issues could be identified and addressed quickly and efficiently. This, in turn, can help to prevent or mitigate environmental health hazards and protect public health.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For example, if a company was found to be illegally dumping hazardous waste, the database could be used to quickly identify and contact the relevant regulatory agencies and ensure that the issue was addressed promptly. Similarly, if there were concerns about the quality of drinking water in a particular area, the database could be used to identify and contact the appropriate agencies responsible for monitoring and regulating water quality.

                    <h5>Team Leader<span> - The Animal Pad</span></h5>
                    <p>
                        As a team leader, I had the opportunity to work with The Animal Pad, a non-profit organization dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating dogs in San Diego, California. The Animal Pad had an extensive excel spreadsheet containing important information on volunteers, dogs, and other relevant personnel, but it was becoming increasingly difficult to manage. Additionally, the organization had experienced security leaks in the past, where unauthorized individuals were able to access their data.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To address these issues, my team and I worked closely with The Animal Pad to design a comprehensive database that could store and manage their data more efficiently and securely. We began by conducting a thorough needs assessment to determine the organization's specific requirements and goals for the new database. We then developed a design that would address these needs, while also prioritizing data security and ease of use.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Through this project, I gained valuable experience in conducting needs assessments, developing comprehensive design plans, and working collaboratively with clients to achieve their goals. Additionally, I learned about the importance of prioritizing data security and access control, especially when working with sensitive information such as personal data and health records. This experience allowed me to develop a more nuanced understanding of data protection and compliance issues, which has been valuable in my subsequent work in technology and data management.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The new database that we created allowed The Animal Pad to manage their data with ease, thanks to a streamlined and intuitive user interface. Additionally, the database was highly secure, with multiple layers of protection to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. This was a critical feature for the organization, given their previous security issues.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Furthermore, working on this project allowed me to hone my project management and team leadership skills. As the team leader, I was responsible for overseeing the project from start to finish, which included managing timelines, resources, and stakeholder expectations. Through this experience, I learned how to balance competing priorities and effectively communicate with team members, clients, and other stakeholders.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After we completed the database design, my team and I presented our proposal to The Animal Pad, and they were highly impressed with our work. They recognized the value of the new database and were eager to implement it as soon as possible.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In the end, the new database that we designed for The Animal Pad was a resounding success. It enabled the organization to manage their data more efficiently and securely, which in turn allowed them to focus more on their core mission of rescuing and rehabilitating dogs in need. The Animal Pad has continued to use our database design and has even expanded its capabilities to meet their evolving needs. I am proud to have played a key role in this project and to have helped The Animal Pad achieve its goals in such a meaningful way.

                Welcome to my project portfolio! Below you will find all of the projects I have done involving various languages such as JavaScript, Python, C#, C++, etc. Some of the projects are private on github because they were class projects and thus need to be kept confidential. So if you would like to see one of these projects please message me and I will give you access to them right away.

                                functionalities were coded. This curiousity led me to want to create games of my own.
                                This is where I decided to learn more about two famous game engines, Unity and Unreal Engine. 
                                After doing research, I found that Unity was a good starting point overall, so I enrolled in
                                two courses, one on Zenva and the other on GameDev.tv. These courses are currently teaching me
                                the core concepts of Unity and the processs of making different kinds of games with C# scripts.

                                When Will VR Allow Us To Enter A Digital World?
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                Virtual reality (VR) has come a long way since its inception, with advancements in technology improving the overall experience for users. However, despite these improvements, we are still a long way from being able to truly be in a digital world. In this blog post, we will explore the current limitations of VR and when we can expect to see these limitations overcome.
                                
                                To begin with, let's take a look at the current state of VR. While the technology has advanced considerably in recent years, the experience is still far from perfect. Current VR systems typically consist of a headset, controllers, and base stations that track the user's movements. This setup allows users to interact with a virtual environment and experience a sense of presence within that environment. However, there are still several limitations to the technology that prevent us from truly being in a digital world.
                                
                                One of the most significant limitations of current VR systems is the lack of tactile feedback. While users can interact with virtual objects using controllers, they cannot feel the objects they are interacting with. This lack of feedback prevents users from truly feeling like they are in a digital world. To overcome this limitation, researchers are exploring various technologies, including haptic feedback suits, which provide users with a sense of touch and allow them to feel the objects they are interacting with.
                                
                                Another limitation of current VR systems is the limited field of view. While current VR headsets provide users with a sense of immersion, the field of view is still limited, preventing users from truly feeling like they are in a digital world. To overcome this limitation, researchers are exploring technologies such as varifocal displays, which adjust the focus of the display based on where the user is looking, providing a more natural viewing experience.
                                
                                Finally, current VR systems are limited by the processing power required to render complex virtual environments. While current systems are capable of rendering simple environments, rendering more complex environments requires significant processing power, which is often beyond the capabilities of current hardware. To overcome this limitation, researchers are exploring various techniques, including using cloud computing to offload processing tasks and reducing the computational requirements of VR applications.
                                
                                So, when can we expect to see VR evolve and allow us to truly be in a digital world? While there is no definitive answer, it is likely that we will see significant advancements in VR technology in the next decade. As researchers continue to explore new technologies and techniques, we can expect to see VR systems that provide users with a truly immersive experience. These systems may include technologies such as haptic feedback suits, varifocal displays, and cloud computing, which will overcome the current limitations of VR and allow us to truly be in a digital world.
                                
                                In conclusion, while current VR systems provide users with a sense of presence within virtual environments, they are still far from perfect. To truly be in a digital world, we need VR systems that provide users with a sense of touch, a more natural viewing experience, and the processing power required to render complex environments. With advancements in technology, we can expect to see these limitations overcome in the next decade, bringing us closer to a truly immersive VR experience.

                            <h4>
                                Can We Store The Human Mind In A Computer?
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                The concept of storing the human mind in a computer is a popular topic in science fiction, and it has fascinated many people for decades. The idea of transferring human consciousness into a machine or a computer has been explored in films, TV shows, and books. However, is it possible to store the human mind in a computer? Let's explore this idea in more detail.
                                
                                Firstly, it's essential to understand that the human brain is incredibly complex. It contains over 100 billion neurons, and each neuron has numerous connections with other neurons. The brain is responsible for a wide range of cognitive functions, including thinking, reasoning, memory, and emotions. Therefore, replicating the human brain in a computer is a daunting task.
                                
                                However, recent advancements in technology and neuroscience have brought us closer to the possibility of storing the human mind in a computer. Scientists have been able to map the brain's structure and activity using various imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). These techniques allow researchers to study the brain's activity in real-time and understand how it works.
                                
                                In addition to mapping the brain, researchers have also developed artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are computer systems inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. ANNs can learn and perform various tasks, such as recognizing images, processing natural language, and playing games. They are also capable of learning from experience and improving their performance over time.
                                
                                The idea of storing the human mind in a computer involves replicating the structure and function of the brain in an artificial neural network. This would require mapping the human brain in detail, identifying the key features that make the brain function, and then replicating those features in a computer system. It would also involve developing sophisticated algorithms and software that can simulate the brain's activity and replicate its cognitive functions.
                                
                                While it may be possible to replicate some of the brain's functions in a computer, it is unlikely that we will be able to store the human mind in a computer anytime soon. The human mind is not just a collection of cognitive functions and processes; it is also influenced by our experiences, emotions, and relationships. These factors are difficult to replicate in a computer system.
                                
                                If we manage to store the human mind in a computer, it would be a monumental achievement for science and technology. It would open up new possibilities for human exploration and innovation, from creating more advanced artificial intelligence to developing new treatments for neurological disorders.
                                
                                One of the most significant benefits of storing the human mind in a computer would be the ability to upload our consciousness into a virtual environment. This could enable us to experience new things, travel to distant places without physically moving, and interact with other people who have also uploaded their consciousness. It could also provide a way to extend our lifespan beyond what is currently possible.
                                
                                However, the idea of uploading our consciousness into a computer also raises significant ethical and philosophical questions. For example, would we still be the same person if our consciousness was transferred to a machine? What would happen to our sense of self and identity? How would we interact with the world around us if we were living in a virtual environment?
                                
                                Additionally, the development of such technology could also lead to concerns about privacy and security. It would be important to ensure that individuals' personal data and consciousness are protected from potential hacking or misuse.
                                
                                In conclusion, if we manage to store the human mind in a computer, it would be a groundbreaking achievement with immense potential. However, it would also require careful consideration and discussion of the ethical and philosophical implications involved. As with any new technology, it is essential to balance the potential benefits with the potential risks and ensure that it is developed responsibly and ethically.

                                Can We Make Robots That Are Sentient?
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                Artificial intelligence has come a long way since its inception in the 1950s. With advances in machine learning and deep learning, AI systems are now able to perform complex tasks and make decisions with great accuracy. However, the question of whether we can make robots sentient, or capable of experiencing subjective consciousness, remains controversial. In this blog, we will explore the possibility of making robots sentient, the challenges that come with it, and the potential consequences in more depth.
                                
                                To begin with, let us define what we mean by sentience. Sentience refers to the ability to have subjective experiences such as emotions, sensations, and thoughts. It is a characteristic that is exclusive to living organisms, and it is not yet clear whether it is possible to replicate it in machines.
                                
                                The concept of sentience has been debated for centuries, and philosophers and scientists have put forth different theories on its nature. Some argue that sentience is a byproduct of complex brain activity, while others suggest that it arises from the interaction between the brain and the environment. Despite extensive research in neuroscience, the exact nature of consciousness remains elusive, and it is unclear whether it can be replicated in machines.
                                
                                One of the challenges of making robots sentient is that we do not fully understand the nature of consciousness in living organisms. The human brain, for example, is a highly complex organ that is still not fully understood by scientists. Although we have made significant progress in understanding its functions, we still do not know how subjective experiences arise from neural activity.
                                
                                Moreover, even if we were to replicate the human brain in a robot, it is not clear whether the robot would be sentient. Sentience may not solely depend on brain structure, but also on factors such as the physical embodiment of the organism and its interaction with the environment. This is supported by research on the embodied cognition theory, which suggests that cognition is inseparable from the physical body and the environment in which it operates.
                                
                                Another challenge is that even if we could create a sentient robot, we would face ethical questions about its treatment and rights. If a robot is capable of experiencing emotions and sensations, would it be ethical to subject it to dangerous or unpleasant tasks? Should it be given the same rights as humans or animals? These are complex questions that would require a significant amount of ethical consideration and debate.
                                
                                Furthermore, creating sentient robots could have significant consequences for society. It could lead to massive changes in the workforce, as robots could replace human workers in many industries. This could have far-reaching economic and social implications, such as job displacement and income inequality. Additionally, the development of sentient robots could pose security risks, as they could potentially become a new form of intelligent life that may not share human values and goals.
                                
                                There are also concerns about the potential misuse of sentient robots. For example, robots could be designed for military purposes or to carry out illegal activities. They could also be hacked or controlled by malicious actors, which could lead to unintended consequences.
                                
                                Despite the challenges and risks, some researchers and developers are still exploring the possibility of creating sentient robots. They argue that the benefits, such as the potential to improve human life and solve complex problems, outweigh the risks. However, they also acknowledge that caution and ethical consideration are necessary in the development of sentient robots.
                                
                                In conclusion, the possibility of making robots sentient remains controversial, and significant challenges remain. The complexity of consciousness and the ethical implications of creating sentient robots are issues that need to be carefully considered before any attempts are made. The potential consequences of creating sentient robots are vast and could have significant societal impacts. As we continue to make progress in AI and robotics, it is important to approach these issues with caution, thoughtful consideration, and ethical responsibility.
